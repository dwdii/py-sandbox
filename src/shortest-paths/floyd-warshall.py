"""
In this assignment you will implement one or more algorithms for the all-pairs
shortest-path problem. Here are data files describing three graphs:

g1.txt
g2.txt
g3.txt

The first line indicates the number of vertices and edges, respectively. Each
subsequent line describes an edge (the first two numbers are its tail and head,
respectively) and its length (the third number). NOTE: some of the edge lengths
are negative. NOTE: These graphs may or may not have negative-cost cycles.

Your task is to compute the "shortest shortest path". Precisely, you must first
identify which, if any, of the three graphs have no negative cycles. For each
such graph, you should compute all-pairs shortest paths and remember the
smallest one (i.e., compute minu,vâˆˆVd(u,v), where d(u,v)d(u,v) denotes the
shortest-path distance from uu to vv).

If each of the three graphs has a negative-cost cycle, then enter "NULL" in the
box below. If exactly one graph has no negative-cost cycles, then enter the
length of its shortest shortest path in the box below. If two or more of the
graphs have no negative-cost cycles, then enter the smallest of the lengths of
their shortest shortest paths in the box below.
